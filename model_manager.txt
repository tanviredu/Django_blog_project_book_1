when we query data we use the "objects" keyword

like Post.objects.get()
     Post.objects.filter()
     Post.objects.create()

objects is a manager which has different function to work. with
with proper filter we can query anything

we can make custom manager that inherit from the base manager
and tweak its parameter

so we make a manager from the base manager and make
configure it so that when it fetch data it will only pull the
post which has
status = 'publish'

that's save  time for filter data
because this manager automatically pull data from published
no longer need to add filter


we will inherit from the models.Manager
and then we have to feed the base constractor with super
then we have to override the 'get_queryset' method

you add multiple manager
remeber you must have to add the default manager with the other manager

because admin panel use the default manager 



then we use the manager to query data
